HackSlider
==========

This was written as I was getting frustrated with using existing opensource
presentation software.  Biggest problem was that LibreOffice and
others are not quite popular yet, so the presentation PC often did not have the
software I chose for making my slides. Or, if I was lucky, they were installed
but had a different version that completely butchered my slides. I felt like
there should be a
better solution to this. It should be easy to write my own
solution that works well for me, even if it means I have write my slides
directly in HTML. When I demo the slides to other people, I don't need them to install
yet another bloated software: a browser is enough. This has some other upsides too if you are good with
Javascript: you can have all kinds of fancy animations you can think of,
including things that you don't get
in everyday presentation software. You can keep tracking changes to your
presentation using a version control system like Git. Finally, you can automate
things: use CSS to automate complicated formatting rules, have your slide
elements resize and reposition correctly when you change screen resolution,
embed a live website right inside your slides, etc. I mean, think about it:
this is exactly what professional designers use to make all your favorite websites.
So it can't be *that* bad to write slides in HTML!

Having made this, I realized that the user needs only basic HTML/CSS understanding to get
started. This means anyone who has ever designed a web page may find it useful
as well. So give it a try! 

 1. You can try the current version from 
https://github.com/samee/hackslider/archive/master.zip
 2. Extract the files. Open `index.html` in a browser
 3. After you are done with the slideshow, see the source code for `index.html`.
    Copy it and modify it to create your own slides
