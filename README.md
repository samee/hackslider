HackSlider
==========

This is a package of Javascript/CSS that makes it easy to write presentation
slides directly in HTML. Every outermost `<div>` automatically becomes a slide,
with built-in keyboard navigation and basic things. Advantages of doing it this
way includes: not requiring installation of anything but a browser, you can keep
tracking changes in version control like Git, you can automate things like
having complicated formatting rules etc. I mean, think about it: all your
favorite websites are professionally made by people directly writing HTML, so it
can't be *that* bad to write slides this way!

Only basic HTML/CSS understanding is needed to get started. This means anyone
who has ever designed a web page may find it useful as well. So give it a try! 

 1. You can try the current version from 
https://github.com/samee/hackslider/archive/master.zip
 2. Extract the files. Open `index.html` in a browser
 3. After you are done with the slideshow, see the source code for `index.html`.
    Copy it and modify it to create your own slides
