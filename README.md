This was written as I was getting frustrated with using existing opensource
presentation software.  Biggest problem would be the fact LibreOffice and
others are not quite popular yet, so the presentation PC will often lack the
software I need. Or, if I'm lucky, they will be installed but have a different
version that completely butchers my slides. It felt like there should be a
better solution to this.  In fact, it should be easy to write up my own
solution that works well for me, even if it means I would to write my slides
directly in HTML. When I show it to other people, I don't need them to install
yet another bloated software. If you are good with Javascript, you can have all
kinds of fancy animations you can think of, including things that you don't get
in everyday presentation software. You can keep tracking changes to your
presentation using a version control system like Git. Finally, you can automate
things: use CSS to automate complicated formatting rules, have your slide
elements resize and reposition correctly when you change screen resolution,
embed a live website right inside your slides, etc.

Having made this, I realized that the user needs only basic HTML/CSS to get
started, which means anyone who has ever designed a web page may find it useful
as well. So give it a try! 

 1. You can try the current version from 
https://github.com/samee/hackslider/archive/master.zip
 2. Extract the files. Open `index.html` in a browser
 3. After you are done with the slideshow, see the source code for `index.html`.
    Copy it and modify it to create your own slides
